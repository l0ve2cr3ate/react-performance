# 6. Fix "Perf Death by a Thousand Cuts" Notes

*Perf death by a thousand cuts*: so many components are updated when state changes, that it becomes a performance bottleneck.
Every performance problem is solved by less code. Often you have components responding to a state change that don't need to. Often we memoize these with `React.memo`. You could do that to all the components in your app, but there are two problems:

1. increases complexity of your app (because you have to start using `useCallback` and `useMemo` for literally everything to take advantage of that, meaning you have a bunch of dependency arrays to manage).
2. React is still doing a bunch of work to check whether these components should be re-rendered.

**Possible solution**: Put less state in global store --> *colocation*: put the state as close as possible to the component(s) that need it. This is a great way to improve both performance and maintenance of your app at the same time.
