# 3. React.memo for reducing unnecessary re-renders

Lifecycle of React app: 
--> render --> reconciliation --> commit --> state change --> render, etc...

- *render phase*: create React elements: `React.createElement`
- *reconciliation phase*: compare previous elements with new ones.
- *commit phase*: update DOM (if needed).

Updating the DOM is the slowest part of this process.

A React component can re-render for any of the following reasons:
1. Its props change
2. Its internal state changes
3. It is consuming context values which have changed
4. Its parent re-renders

You can opt-out of state updates for part of the React tree by using one of React's built-in rendering bail-out utilities: `React.Purecomponent` (for class components), `React.memo` (for functional components) or `shouldComponentUpdate` (for class components).
They make sure your component won't rerender because its parents re-rendered. Wrapping everything in `React.memo` can slow your app down, so use it intentionally.

`React.memo` accepts a custom compare function as a second argument, that allows you to compare props and return true if rendering the component again is unnecessary and false if necessary. If you pass primitive values, you don't need a custom compare function and can take advantage of React's built-in comparision.
