# 1. Code Splitting Notes

Principle: loading less code to speed up your app.
Javascript has dynamic imports:

```javascript
import('./some-module.js').then(
    module => {},
    error => {}
)
```

React has built-in support foor loading modules as React components. The module must have a React component as default export, and you have to use `<React.Suspense>` component to render a fallback value while the user waits for the module to be loaded:

```javascript
const SomeComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./some-component'))

const App = () => (
    <React.Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <SomeComponent />
    </React.Suspense>
)
```

A great way to analyse you app to determine the need/benefit of code splitting for a certain feature/page/interaction is to use the *Coverage* feature of the Chrome DevTools. It can also help you find unused JS and CSS code.

If you use Webpack *magic comments* can be used to instruct the browser prefetch dynamic imports: 

```javascript
import(/* webpackPrefetch: true */ './some-module.js')
```

The `webpackChunkName` magic comment which will allow webpack to place common modules in the same chunk, which can lower the amount of request needed to be made to the server.
