# 7. Production Performance Monitoring Notes

React Profiler API measures how often a React app renders and what the "cost" of rendering is. Purpose: help identify parts of the app that are slow and may benefit from optimization such as memoization.
`<Profiler />` can be added anywhere in React tree. It requires two props:

- id (string)
- onRender callback (function), which React calls any time a component within the tree commits an update.

`onRender` callback receives params describing what was rendered and how long it took:

- id
- phase: "mount" or "updated"
- actualDuration: time spent rendering commited update
- baseDuration: estimated time to render entire subtree without memoization
- startTime: when React began rendering this update
- commitTime: when React committed this update
- interactions: set of interactions belonging to this update
