# 5. Optimize Context Value Notes

Context triggers a re-render of all consuming components whenever the provided value changes from one render to another. The consuming components will re-render, whether they are memoized or not.

```javascript
function CountProvider(props) {
    const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
    const value = [count, setCount];

    return <CountContext.Provider value={value} {...props} />
}
```

Every time `<CountProvider />` is re-rendered, the `value` is new, so even though `count` itself may be the same, all component consumers will be re-rendered.

**Possible solution**:
memoize value that you provide to context provider: 

```javascript
const value = React.useMemo(() => [count, setCount], [count])
```
